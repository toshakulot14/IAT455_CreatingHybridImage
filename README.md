IAT 455 GroupProject: Creating Hybrid Images

<br/><br/>
So our codes will be here. The folder for our code project will be <i> "Project_CreatingHybridImages" </i>. <br/><br/>

I put up codes during the lab for reference as well (for week 3 and 9 specifically). They are in <i> "Lab Code (for reference)" </i> folder.<br/><br/>

If possible, create a new branch first before modifying code, then make a pull request. It's so that code versions wouldn't be messy.
